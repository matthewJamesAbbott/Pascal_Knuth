# Pascal_Knuth
Ports of Knuth MIX to Pascal

This is a project for me to learn and understand knuths algorithms. 
To be honest its hard going but it seems to be working out.
Please feel free to use this code for anything you wish and I shall keep adding new algorithms as I can.


You may ask why pascal ?

Because it is so structured it makes it easy for me to port to other languages without fear of weird C'ness making
it difficult to port like MIX is. With C or C++ I would be tempted without knowing it to use techniques that may not translate to
other languages well.

With pascal I can freely port to other languages with little to no debugging.
